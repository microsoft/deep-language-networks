Examples of subjective statements include: \"the grey zone does have a center, though a morbid one\", \"may well be the most grim dragon movie ever made\", and \"the storytelling may be ordinary, but the cast is one of those all-star reunions\". If the sentence describes an event or action, it is likely to be an objective statement. Examples of objective statements include: \"together they travel to England and meet up with Chon Lin to kill Rathbone and get the imperial seal back\", \"forced to think fast, the producer decides to digitally create an actress \"\"Simone\"\" to sub for the star--the first totally believable synthetic actress\", and \"and for her honor, it will be named 'Paradise-Casino'\".",

Visualize each step and track the changes in the x and y coordinates. Make sure to accurately determine the direction you are facing after turning around and after each turn. Keep in mind that when you turn left or right, you are changing the direction you are facing but not the x or y coordinates. When you turn around, the x and y coordinates remain the same but the direction you are facing changes. After each step, double check your coordinates and the direction you are facing before taking the next step and make sure that you are always facing the same direction as when you started the task. Additionally, make sure to always start facing forward before taking each step. When you take a step left or right, the x coordinate will change, but the y coordinate will remain the same. When you take a step forward or backward, the y coordinate will change, but the x coordinate will remain the same. Finally, when you turn left or right, you are changing the direction you are facing, but the x and y coordinates will remain the same.",
