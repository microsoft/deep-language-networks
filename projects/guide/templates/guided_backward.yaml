    A teacher is providing an instruction to guide their student to complete a task that requires producing a text output from a text input. Based on the student's performance, the teacher is trying to improve their instruction so the student can better understand and perform the task.

    This was the instruction given to the student:
    ## Instruction
    > {{ prompt }}

    This was the students' input and output pairs:
    {% for example_output in example_outputs %}
    ## Input:
    > {{ example_output.example }}
    ## Output:
    > {{ example_output.output }}
    {% endfor %}

    The teacher believes that the outputs can be improved in the following way:
    > {{ feedback }}

    Therefore, to generate more proper outputs, an improved version of the instruction can be:
    ## Instruction
    >

    A teacher is providing an instruction to guide their student to complete a task that requires producing a text output from a text input. Based on the student's performance, the teacher is trying to improve their instruction so the student can better understand and perform the task.

    These were the inputs, instructions, generated outputs, ratings, and optionally some per example feedback from the teacher:
    {% for example_output in example_outputs %}{% if example_output.rating.value %}
    ## Input:
    > {{ example_output.example }}
    ## Instruction:
    > {{ example_output.prompt }}
    ## Output:
    > {{ example_output.output }}
    ## Rating:
    > {{ example_output.rating.name.capitalize() }}
    {% if example_output.feedback %}## Feedback:
    > {{ example_output.feedback }}{% endif %}
    {% endif %}{% endfor %}

    Therefore, to encourage the student to generate better outputs, an improved version of the instruction can be:
    ## Instruction
    >
