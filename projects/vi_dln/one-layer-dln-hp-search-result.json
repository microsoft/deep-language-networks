Additionally, consider the fact that in some contexts the day may come before the month (e.g. in the UK). For example, if the given context is \"It is 4/19/1969 today. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?\", you can infer that a month ago is 3/19/1969 and the correct answer would be (A) 03/19/1969. If the given context is \"The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?\", you can infer that one week ago is 11/16/1933 and the correct answer would be (A) 11/16/1933. Similarly, if the given context includes a timeframe (e.g. yesterday, one year ago, etc.), you will need to subtract or add the specified amount of time to the given date to find the correct answer. For example, if the given context is \"Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. Today is their golden wedding anniversary. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?\" then the student should subtract Jan 2, 1958 from Jan 2, 2018 to get the number of days between them and then add that number of days to Jan 2, 2018 to get the correct answer, which is (A) 01/03/2008. If the given context includes two dates and the student needs to calculate the number of days between them, then the student should subtract the earlier date from the later date to get the number of days and then add or subtract that number of days to the later date to get the answer. For example, if the given context is \"Today is 8/3/1997 and one year ago was 7/31/1996. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?\", then the student should subtract 7/31/1996 from 8/3/1997 to get the number of days between them and then subtract the number of days from 8/3/1997 to get the correct answer, which is (A) 08/02/1997. If the given context includes a sequence of dates, such as a pattern of dates that occur consecutively (e.g. every second Thursday), the student should use the given date as a reference point and add or subtract the specified amount\n"

Pay close attention to the context of the sentence - if someone or something is *falling for* or *falling back*, it is likely to be an objective statement. Pay attention to any words that express an opinion or emotion, such as \"uncomfortable\", \"suffocating\", \"grim\", \"play it straight\", \"ordinary\" and \"all-star reunions\". If the sentence expresses an opinion, it is likely to be a subjective statement.

A positive sentiment is generally expressed with words and phrases of appreciation, gratitude, enthusiasm, and approval, whereas a negative sentiment is generally expressed with words and phrases of disapproval, disappointment, dissatisfaction, and criticism. Consider the context and tone of the statement in order to assess the sentiment accurately. Pay special attention to words that can be interpreted both positively and negatively, and consider the overall context and tone of the statement to assess sentiment accurately. Pay attention to the context and tone of the statement, not just the words used. For example, a statement like “Welllllll.... RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dHHomG2kiX” could be neutral sentiment even though the words “on fleek” could be interpreted as a positive sentiment. Additionally, consider sarcasm and irony when assessing sentiment. For example, \"@USAirways comin in clutch and sending me to Charlotte then home, I h8 u @AmericanAir, except for Wayne u a real g #ThankJesus #ThankMe\" is a negative sentiment despite the words \"comin in clutch\" suggesting a positive sentiment. Pay special attention to express words of gratitude, disappointment, criticism, appreciation, and dissatisfaction; these words offer important context to the sentiment of the statement. Consider the tone of the statement, not just the words used. For example, a statement like \"@JetBlue I cant look up my confirmation number at the moment on mobile. The email is no longer in my inbox\" is a neutral sentiment despite the words \"cant\" suggesting a negative sentiment. Additionally, a statement like \"@VirginAmerica is saving my sanity right now: http://t.co/ELtBOLjUl9\" is a neutral sentiment despite the word \"saving\" suggesting a positive sentiment. When assessing sentiment, be aware of sarcasm and irony. For example, \"@USAirways thank you for the apology\" is a neutral sentiment despite the words \"thank you\" suggesting a positive sentiment. Pay special attention to statements that include words that could be interpreted both positively and negatively; consider the overall context and tone of the statement to assess sentiment accurately.
